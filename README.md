> 🔬 A research project using R and machine learning to predict diabetes in the Pima Indian population, featuring an interactive Shiny app.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Diabetes is a major health issue, particularly among the Pima Indian population, who are genetically predisposed to the condition. This project uses data science and machine learning to identify key predictors of diabetes and develop a web-based prediction tool.

## ❓ Research Question

> **How do medical and demographic factors impact diabetes prediction, and which machine learning model provides the most accurate classification?**

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset  
- **Origin:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) via NIDDK  
- **Samples:** 768  
- **Target Variable:** Diabetes diagnosis (`1 = Diabetes`, `0 = No Diabetes`)

## 🧪 Methods

### 🔍 Data Analysis & Visualization
- Tools: `ggplot2`, `corrplot`, `dplyr`
- Explored variable distribution, correlation heatmaps, and class balance

## 📈 Key Results

| Model              | Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 77%      |
| Random Forest       | 77%      |
| Naive Bayes         | 76%      |
| Neural Network      | 73%      |

### 🔑 Top Predictors
- **Glucose**: Strongest predictor
- **BMI & Age**: Also highly influential
- Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, and Insulin had weaker predictive power

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Improve preprocessing & missing value handling
- Test additional machine learning models
- Optimize and deploy Shiny app for public use
